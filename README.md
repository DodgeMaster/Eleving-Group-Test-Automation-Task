## Test Prioritization

| â„– | Test Scenario | Priority | Failure Risk |

| **1** | **Validating car filters** (brand, year, fuel type, gearbox) | ðŸŸ¥ **P0 â€“ Critical** | Core functionality. If filters fail, users canâ€™t find relevant cars that cause direct revenue loss. 

| **2** | **Page navigation to car details** | ðŸŸ¥ **P0 â€“ Critical** | Users canâ€™t access full info or submit leads. Major blocker for conversions. 

| **3** | **Checking sorting options** (newest listings, price order) | ðŸŸ§ **P1 â€“ High** | Impacts trust and UX. Wrong sorting frustrates users and misrepresents offers.

| **4** | **Ensuring currency toggle updates prices** | ðŸŸ§ **P1 â€“ High** | Important for international users. Incorrect currency conversion undermines credibility.

| **5** | **Handling cookies banner & dynamic/async content** | ðŸŸ¨ **P2 â€“ Medium** | Legal (GDPR) and UX compliance. Issues affect user experience.

> **Legend:**   
> - **P0** â€“ must test first (critical for business)  
> - **P1** â€“ high value, but not blocking  
> - **P2** â€“ secondary / nice-to-have coverage
